Torc Book Library is a full-stack application designed to help users manage and explore a collection of books. The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend API** (`Torc.BookLibrary.API`): Handles all server-side operations, including data storage, retrieval, and business logic.
- **Frontend UI** (`Torc.BookLibrary.UI`): Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the book library.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the application locally, please follow the instructions provided in the README files for each project:

- **Backend:**  
  See `Torc.BookLibrary.API/README.md` for steps to install dependencies, configure the environment, and start the API server.

- **Frontend:**  
  See `Torc.BookLibrary.UI/README.md` for steps to install dependencies and launch the web interface.

Each README contains detailed setup instructions, prerequisites, and troubleshooting tips specific to that part of the project.
